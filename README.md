Gossh is a high-performance and high-concurrency ssh tool written in Go.
It can efficiently manage tens of thousands of Linux server clusters.
It is 10 times faster than `Ansible`.
If you need much more performance and better ease of use, you will love `gossh`.

Feel free to open a new issue if you have any issues, questions or suggestions about this project.

## Features

- Supports four types of ssh tasks.  
  `command`: Execute commands on target hosts.  
  `script`: Execute a local shell script on target hosts.  
  `push`: Copy local files and dirs to target hosts.  
  `fetch`: Copy files and dirs from target hosts to local.

- Supports four authentication methods.  
  `SSH-Agent Authentication`: through the system environment variable `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.  
  `Pubkey Authentication`: by identity files(Default `$HOME/.ssh/{id_rsa,id_dsa}`), also support that with passphrase.  
  `Password`: from command line flag `-k/--auth.ask-pass` or `-p/--auth.password`, or from configuration file.  
  `Password File`: file that containing `username:password`, and it has lower priority than auth method `Password`.  
  `Gossh` will auto detected the supported authentication methods, and if no legal authentication methods detected, it will prompt user to enter password of login user(Default `$USER`).

- Supports two ways to specify target hosts. One is through command line arguments, input one or more target hosts, separated by space. The other is through command line flag or configuration file option to specify the hosts file. Both ways can be used at the same time.

- Supports expanding host patterns that from commandline arguments or a hosts file to host list,
  and deduplicate the host list.  
  Supported host patterns e.g.:

  ```text
  10.16.0.[1-10]
  foo[01-03].bar.com
  foo[01-03,06,12-16].bar.com
  foo[01-03,06,12-16].[beijing,wuhan].bar.com
  foo[01-03,06,12-16].idc[1-3].[beijing,wuhan].bar.com
  ```

- Supports using `sudo` to execute the commands/shell-script or fetch files/dirs as other user(default is `root`).

- Supports specifying i18n environment variable value while executing commands or a shell script to help keep the language of the outputs consistent. For example: `zh_CN.UTF-8`, `en_US.UTF-8`.

- Supports three kinds of timeout:  
  Timeout for connecting each target host (default `10` seconds).  
  Timeout for executing commands or a shell script on each target host,
  or pushing local files/dirs to each target host,
  or fetching files/dirs from each target host to local.  
  Timeout for the current `gossh` task.

- Supports printing output to a file or screen or a file and screen at the same time.  
  Supports json format output, colorful output, verbose(debug) output, and silent output.

- High-performance and high-concurrency. You can specify number of concurrent connections (default `1`).

- For ease of use, it supports config file. You can write flags that are not frequently modified into the config file, so you don't need to laboriously specify these flags on the command line. If the flag in both command line and config file, flag that from command line takes precedence over the other.  
  The default configuration file is `$PWD/.gossh.yaml` or `$HOME/.gossh.yaml`, and `$PWD/.gossh.yaml` has a higher priority.

- Provides the subcommand `config` to help users generate configuration file in easy way.

- Supports SSH Proxy, it can connect to the target hosts by specifying the ssh proxy server.

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/windvalley/gossh/releases).

Also you can install `gossh` by compiling:

```sh
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/windvalley/gossh

$ cd gossh

# Note: need to install Go environment first.
$ make && make install
```

## Usage

```sh
$ gossh -h

This tool can efficiently manage tens of thousands of Linux server clusters.
It can efficiently execute commands or a local script on target hosts,
push files and dirs to target hosts, and fetch files and dirs from target hosts to local.

## Performance

Client server: `4vCPUs` and `8GiB`

Target servers: `hosts.list` contains `936` servers distributed in `86` different IDCs across the country.

**Ansible:**

```sh
$ time ansible all -i hosts.list -m command -a "uptime" -k -f 100
```

Output:

```text
...

real    1m18.858s
user    3m18.566s
sys     1m24.263s
```

**Gossh:**

```sh
$ time gossh command -H hosts.list -e "uptime" -c 100
```

Output:

```text
...

level=INFO time=2021-12-22 23:06:50 msg=success count: 936, failed count: 0, elapsed: 6.30s

real    0m6.316s
user    0m13.529s
sys     0m0.592s
