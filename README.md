Gossh is a high-performance and high-concurrency ssh tool.
This tool can efficiently manage tens of thousands of Linux server clusters.
It can efficiently execute commands, execute a shell script, transfer files and dirs, etc.

## Features

- Supports three types of ssh tasks.  
  `exec`: Execute commands on remote hosts.  
  `script`: Execute a local shell script on remote hosts.  
  `push`: Push local files and dirs to remote hosts.

- Supports using `sudo` to execute the commands or a shell script as other user(default is `root`).

- Supports specifying i18n environment variable value while executing commands or a shell script to help keep the language of the outputs consistent. For example: `zh_CN.UTF-8`, `en_US.UTF-8`.

- Supports four authentication methods.  
  `SSH-Agent Authentication`: through the system environment variable `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.  
  `Pubkey Authentication`: by identity files(Default `$HOME/.ssh/{id_rsa,id_dsa}`), also support that with passphrase.  
  `Password`: from command line flag `-k/--auth.ask-pass` or `-p/--auth.password`, or from configuration file.  
  `Password File`: file that containing `username:password`, and it has lower priority than auth method `Password`.  
  `Gossh` will auto detected the supported authentication methods, and if no legal authentication methods detected, it will prompt user to enter password of login user(Default `$USER`).

- Supports two ways to specify target hosts. One is through command line arguments, input one or more target hosts, separated by space. The other is through command line flag or configuration file option to specify the hosts file. Both ways can be used at the same time.

- Supports expanding host patterns that from commandline arguments or a hosts file to host list,
  and deduplicate the host list.  
  Supported host patterns e.g.:

  ```text
  10.16.0.[1-10]
  foo[01-03].bar.com
  foo[01-03,06,12-16].bar.com
  foo[01-03,06,12-16].[beijing,wuhan].bar.com
  foo[01-03,06,12-16].idc[1-3].[beijing,wuhan].bar.com
  ```

- Supports three kinds of timeout:  
  Timeout for connecting each remote host (default `10` seconds).  
  Timeout for executing commands or a shell script on each remote host or pushing each file/dir to each remote host.  
  Timeout for the current `gossh` task.

- Supports printing the execution results of `gossh` to a file or screen or a file and screen at the same time. Supports json format output. Supports printing debug information. Supports silent output.

- High-performance and high-concurrency. You can specify number of concurrent connections (default `1`).

- For ease of use, it supports config file. You can write flags that are not frequently modified into the config file, so you don't need to laboriously specify these flags on the command line. If the flag in both command line and config file, flag that from command line takes precedence over the other. The default config file is: `~/.gossh.yaml`.

- Provide the subcommand `config` to help users generate configuration file in easy way.

- Supports SSH Proxy, it can connect to the target hosts by specifying the ssh proxy server.

## Installation

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Linux can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/windvalley/gossh/releases).

Also you can install `gossh` by compiling:

```sh
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/windvalley/gossh

$ cd gossh

# Note: need to install Go environment first.
$ make && make install
```

## Usage

```sh
$ gossh -h

## Performance

Client server: `4vCPUs` and `8GiB`

Target servers: `hosts.list` contains `936` servers distributed in `86` different IDCs across the country.

**Ansible:**

```sh
$ time ansible all -i hosts.list -m command -a "uptime" -k -f 100
```

Output:

```text
...

real    1m18.858s
user    3m18.566s
sys     1m24.263s
```

**Gossh:**

```sh
$ time gossh exec -H hosts.list -e "uptime" -c 100
```

Output:

```text
...

time=2021-12-22 23:06:50 level=info msg=success count: 936, failed count: 0, elapsed: 6.30s

real    0m6.316s
user    0m13.529s
sys     0m0.592s
